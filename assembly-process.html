									  <div class="carousel-cell">
										<img src="images/assembly/finalconcept.jpg" alt="The final concept was used as a reference to
										start the assembly. The springs, lever, and spool were created and assembled inside a box. ">
									</div>

									  <div class="carousel-cell">
											<img src="images/assembly/smallcase_labeled.jpg" alt="The case was too small to accommodate
											all the parts. Therefore, we increased the case size.">

										</div>
									  <div class="carousel-cell">
											<img src="images/assembly/largecase.jpg" alt="We then added brake pads. The very
											tall height however became a concern.">
									</div>
									  <div class="carousel-cell">
											<img src="images/assembly/brakepadvertical.jpg" alt="Therefore, we flipped the hard
											brake system horizontally, since the horizontal width was limited by the spool size anyways.
											Additionally, with our current hard brake system, the pin would be pulled out more evenly over both
											springs if the two were oriented horizontally.">
									</div>
									<div class="carousel-cell">
										<img src="images/assembly/brakepadhorizontal.jpg" alt="We then added the piston system.">
								</div>
								<div class="carousel-cell">
									<img src="images/assembly/pistonsystem.jpg" alt="We noticed that there was a lot of space on the
									left-hand side.">
							</div>

								<div class="carousel-cell">
									<img src="images/assembly/spaceonleft.jpg" alt="Therefore, we moved the hard brake
									system over to the left side. With this, we were also able to make the static
									brake pads into a single large brake pad.">
							</div>
							<div class="carousel-cell">
								<img src="images/assembly/hardbrakeonleft.jpg" alt="We then increased the thickness of the
								large static brake pad in order to make it fixed and sturdier. ">
						</div>

						<div class="carousel-cell">
							<img src="images/assembly/largebrakepad.jpg" alt="We then added arms to the crank.">
					</div>

					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<img src="images/assembly/sidewaysarm.gif" alt="We noticed that the arm is free to rotate
						and move around, which could mess up our weight registration.">
				</div>

					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<img src="images/assembly/sidewaysarm.jpg" alt="Therefore, we added a box to restrict the
						movement. We realized that the arm still has to move sideways slightly because of the crank
						movement, so we left some additional space for it to be able to move around slightly.">
				</div>

				<div class="carousel-cell">
					<img src="images/assembly/armlimitbox.jpg" alt="This was the progress of our model.">
			</div>

			<div class="carousel-cell">
				<img src="images/assembly/progress_1.jpg" alt="We then looked into the hard brake mechanism.">
		</div>

		<div class="carousel-cell">
			<img src="images/assembly/initialrailconcept.jpg" alt="We added a rail system to pull out the
			block more easily, since there was supposed to be 500 lbs of force pushing against the part
			to be pulled out. The carriage is the part to be pulled out.">
	</div>

	<div class="carousel-cell">
		<img src="images/assembly/initialrail.jpg" alt="However, we decided that the carriage would
		be too difficult to pull out by the user since the case itself was already big, and therefore
		we changed the orientation to be horizontal. During this time, the fillets were removed from
		the cylinder and piston after deciding that this was a one-time brake and therefore did not
		need to have a very smooth glide. Removing the fillets allowed the whole hard brake to be
		attached to two wall of the case, stabilizing it.">
</div>

<div class="carousel-cell">
	<img src="images/assembly/hardbrake.gif" alt="We then attached a rope and added a handle
	to pull out the block.">
</div>

<div class="carousel-cell">
	<img src="images/assembly/handlebrake.jpg" alt="Next, we modified the bottom arm to have a
	hole where we will attach the user to the system. Additionally, to reduce the overall
	weight of the system, we removed the box restricting the arm and instead made a hole
	on the bottom of the case to pass the arm through. We also added a horizontal bar passing
	between the hard brake and crank brake, in order to prevent the crank brake spring
	from moving up being carried by the rope spooling out.">
</div>

<div class="carousel-cell">
	<img src="images/assembly/armshape.jpg" alt="However, we noticed that when the spring
	is fully compressed (and hence lines up with the fully compressed spring on the hard brake),
	 the spring and spring cups hit the rope guide.">
</div>

<div class="carousel-cell">
	<img src="images/assembly/springhitsguide.jpg" alt="Therefore, we moved the components
	up.">
</div>

<div class="carousel-cell">
	<img src="images/assembly/movedbrakeup.jpg" alt="This was our completed assembly.">
</div>

<div class="carousel-cell">
	<img src="images/assembly/finalassembly.jpg" alt="There were many modifications made
	to our original design concept, that only became evident to be necessary after
	putting the components together and assembling them.">
